2016-08-02 16:07:18	ecmabot	MikeD_: Modules divide programs into clusters of code that, by some criterion, belong together. "!es6 modules" are second-class, but JS can encode first-class ones. Major implementations include CommonJS, Node modules (a variant of CJS), and AMD. All of them can be used in any JS VM, including browsers. See also: http://robotlolita.me/2013/06/06/node-modules-to-rule-them-all.html and http://eloquentjavascript.net/10_modules.html.

2016-08-03 09:07:16	Sorella	lucyfx: whether you can change those values or not, whether you clone the values or not. None of that is relevant to pass-by-value vs. pass-by-ref.

2016-08-03 09:18:47	Sorella	lucyfx: though the description "pass variable names around" is kinda too close to "pass-by-name", which is a very different thing. That's why I prefer phrasing it in terms of "pass L-values around", which is both well-defined and simple, but requires people to understand the concept of an L-value first.

2016-08-03 09:19:53	Sorella	There's also things like pass-by-need, and other models of evaluation that have very different rules, but overlap with some of these meanings. pass-by-need is kind of a pass-by-name where you only evaluate the name when you need to, however you never evaluate it more than once.

2016-08-03 09:20:26	Sorella	Where in pass-by-name you have `a = 1 + 2; f(a, a)`, and `1 + 2` is evaluated twice. In pass-by-need it's only evaluated once.

2016-08-03 10:43:53	Sorella	einar: everything in JS is synchronous. When you call a function from JS, that function will be fully executed before anything else can execute. The only thing that's not synchronous in JS is promises (and obviously host objects, but that's just because (1) those aren't specified; and (2) they can do literally anything they want, including violate the JS

2016-08-03 11:03:54	Sorella	einar: EVERYTHING in JS is under "run to completion". Callbacks and asynchronous execution don't change that. Again, it sounds like you're too fixed on the term "run to completion". The term just means "no code can stop your code from executing. Unless you explicitly say that you're done". You can do that by writing something like "return foo" in your
2016-08-03 11:03:54	Sorella	function, for example, or by writing `"foo()"`, where you transfer control to `foo` until `foo` returns.

And when it runs, it'll take exclusive control of the JS VM, nothiing will be able to run while `f` is running.

2016-08-03 11:16:22	ecmabot	einar: Promises are placeholders for values that'll be provided in the future. They allow composing asynchronous operations like synchronous ones. See http😕 /robotlolita.me/2015/11/15/how-do-promises-work.html and https😕 /blog.domenic.me/youre-missing-the-point-of-promises/. Contrast with !cps & see https😕 /bevacqua.github.io/promisees/

2016-08-03 15:51:24	patarr	fcanela, deltab: what a screwy bug. So I knew the whole time I was hitting the wrong URL (so I could get a 404), but I didn't know that I had a bug in my server that made the response hang when you hit a non existent URL. So what I'm assuming happened is that supertest timed out the request itself, but this takes longer than the default of 2000ms. So cranking up the timeout did the trick, and also alerted me to the real issue.

2016-08-03 15:55:04	patarr	fcanela, my hypothesis is that stepping through lines in the debugger slowed time down in the node.js event loop. So while I was stepping through slowly, the extremely slow 404 response came back and supertest was able to report the status mismatch. But when running normally, the actual mocha timeout was too fast for supertest to even run validation on the response.

2016-08-04 14:43:43	cake`	n> var foo = Function.call(Object.create(Object.prototype), "a", "return a*a"); foo(3)
2016-08-04 14:43:45	babelboot	cake`: (okay) 9

2016-08-04 14:45:16	cake`	ohh i should've used Function.prototype .. it worked anyway

2016-08-04 14:47:16	Sorella	qswz: `Function(args..., body)` constructs a new function function with `args` as parameters and `body` as the body of the function. `Function.call` just shifts those arguments one position to the right, so the first argument is `this`, which isn't really used by the `Function` constructor.
2016-08-04 14:47:44	cake`	yes: Foo(){ return this; }; new Foo(); is the SAME as Foo.call(Object.create(Foo.prototype))
2016-08-04 14:47:48	Sorella	qswz: you could use `Function.call(undefined, ...)` or `Function.call(Function.call, ...)`. The first argument is just ignored there
2016-08-04 14:47:58	qswz	ok

2016-08-04 14:48:15	cake`	it was wonderful to get that to know

2016-08-04 14:50:14	cake`	but iirc changing Function.prototype is one of the things js doesn't like
