2016-08-02 15:05:07	bronzehedwick	JamesMcCoyGitter: ah ha! thank you!
2016-08-02 15:06:46	a-109-107	regarding truecolor, I follow head, have the same $TERM (rxvt-unicode-256color) inside and outside tmux, but colors act weirdly, and both incorrect, inside and outside tmux; suckless's st term displays colors correctly though
2016-08-02 15:14:06	jaawerth	a-109-107: have you tried it with the standard xterm-256color outside tmux ant screen-256color inside tmux?
2016-08-02 15:16:11	a-109-107	jaawerth outside didn't work, inside seemed to only work partially (initial theme is correct, subsequent not)
2016-08-02 15:16:58	jaawerth	hm. do other themes work?
2016-08-02 15:17:35	a-109-107	if I start with gruvbox, it seems correct, when I switch, the colors are messed up, but in less horrid ways inside tmux than outside
2016-08-02 15:17:41	a-109-107	should I share my env?
2016-08-02 15:18:10	jaawerth	wouldn't hurt
2016-08-02 15:18:21	JamesMcCoyGitter	@nhooyr: Did you try contacting the current maintainer of man.vim before making all these enhancements?  He was responsive to my email about MANWIDTH.  I'd be interested what his response was or if he'd be willing to comaintain, so Vim users can see these benefits too
2016-08-02 15:19:17	jaawerth	someone can correct me if I'm wrong, but I seem to recall setting themes more than once can have odd effects if all the colors being set by one theme aren't overridden by another
2016-08-02 15:20:09	jaawerth	a-109-107: if you're setting background, it also helps to make sure that happens *after* any scheme-setting

2016-08-02 15:28:52	jaawerth	a-109-107: if it works okay in some terminal emulators but not others, my guess would have to be that it's related to how the vt color settings are interacting with the vim/tmux color settings
2016-08-02 15:29:46	jaawerth	I use guake and terminator and I seem to remember having to do some extra stuff to make sure guake rendered things correctly
2016-08-02 15:29:53	a-109-107	the thing is, I moved my dotfiles from another laptop, where I had an 'almost' identical setup, and this definitely worked;

2016-08-02 15:30:41	a-109-107	okay, thanks; could you then tell me if it means anything that I get worse results (outside tmux) when I have termguicolors in init.vim?
2016-08-02 15:32:20	JustinMKeyesGitt	@jamessan I forked man.vim awhile ago as a workaround because `!man foo` doesn't work well in nvim. In the meantime the Vim version made its own changes
2016-08-02 15:33:01	JustinMKeyesGitt	I'm ok with us maintaining a fork of this plugin (and considered myself its maintainer until nhooyr fell into the trap)
2016-08-02 15:33:05	jaawerth	a-109-107: that almost sounds like tmux is doing something to give you the right color settings and it isn't present when not usingi t
2016-08-02 15:33:20	jaawerth	which makes sense, since tmux is built to normalize your environment across various contexts
2016-08-02 15:34:02	JamesMcCoyGitter	@justinmk Ok. Still doesn't answer my main question. ;)
2016-08-02 15:34:19	JamesMcCoyGitter	Was there an attempt to collaborate?

2016-08-02 15:47:38	JustinMKeyesGitt	@jamessan I did not attempt. At the time, the plugin had not been updated in years. And it was not popular. Then suddenly it became popular...
2016-08-02 15:49:20	JustinMKeyesGitt	In general I'm not opposed to forking runtime plugins if someone actually takes ownership of the fork. So I did that in this case. And had little motivation to collaborate with vim_dev on something that--at the time--seemed totally irrelevant to Vim.
2016-08-02 15:49:46	JamesMcCoyGitter	Well, vim_dev usually isn't relevant for collaborating on runtime files
2016-08-02 15:50:24	JustinMKeyesGitt	read "vim_dev" as "guy listed at the top of a file that hasn't been updated in years"
2016-08-02 15:50:35	JustinMKeyesGitt	and ultimately vim_dev has to accept the changes

2016-08-02 16:09:01	jaawerth	good enough for my purposes, though
2016-08-02 16:09:22	jaawerth	since typically I'll use terminator or pynvim for long sessions, and guake is just for quick-access stuff

2016-08-03 09:10:45	LeoNerd	Multiple terminal UIs would be a fun thing, but the question becomes how does the process obtain its second TTY instance
2016-08-03 09:11:03	LeoNerd	There -are- ways to do that, but I'm not aware of any terminal (pangoterm included) which would easily coöperate into arranging it
2016-08-03 09:11:17	flip214	well, screen or tmux do similar things.
2016-08-03 09:11:43	LeoNerd	Not in the slightest
2016-08-03 09:11:50	flip214	basically, have another nvim instance that uses RPC to fetch another instance's buffers and lines... like having a tty process accessing a backend process
2016-08-03 09:12:03	JamesMcCoyGitter	Why would it need multiple TTY instances?  I think the intent would be to have the terminal UI communicate over msgpack to a backend just like the graphical UIs do
2016-08-03 09:12:07	LeoNerd	Oh, well *that* you could do but that seems a longwinded way around doing it
2016-08-03 09:12:42	CcxCZ	I didn't mean spawning new windows from neovim, that's harder (while still possible). But neovim --attach somesession is easy enough.
2016-08-03 09:12:48	JamesMcCoyGitter	So the UIs just use the TTY they're attached to and the backend handles the editing logic

2016-08-03 09:13:14	flip214	not much longer now, and "nvim &" can replace tmux, screen, and emacs all-in-one-package! ;)
2016-08-03 09:13:21	LeoNerd	But that's only a short distance away from an abstract neovim server with lightweight connected frontends

2016-08-03 09:55:45	CcxCZ	FireFly: If you mean several processes to be displayed on the same terminal, then you're fighting with the OS. Either it's the same open file and it interleaves as you'd expect but is inseparable or buffering scrambles the order. You'd have to do some very explicit synchronization there.
2016-08-03 09:57:08	FireFly	hence the multiplexing
2016-08-03 09:57:43	FireFly	But yeah, I guess it'd get messy
2016-08-03 10:00:03	CcxCZ	Basically you'd have to put synchronizeWithMultipexer() after each flush() or unbuffered write().
2016-08-03 10:00:38	CcxCZ	Ie. it's not really possibly without changing the apps that you want to run.
2016-08-03 10:00:55	LeoNerd	several processes on the same TTY is just a matter of using screen/tmux/etc.. in split views
2016-08-03 10:01:00	CcxCZ	LD_PRELOAD hack would perhaps suffice … but talk about messy.
2016-08-03 10:01:08	LeoNerd	The feature we were talking about earlier was the exact opposite - one process talking to multiple TTYs
2016-08-03 10:01:44	CcxCZ	Yeah, I'm not sure what FireFly meant with "multiplexing output from multiple jobs" so I took a guess.

2016-08-03 10:06:03	LeoNerd	Yah

2016-08-03 10:11:22	snacks	I'm pretty sure the answer is "yes", but this is the fourth or fifth time I've tried to make it work without success and the documentation is just so bloody useless.
2016-08-03 10:12:47	snacks	"*neoinclude* is the framework for |neocomplete|/|deoplete|.
2016-08-03 10:12:47	snacks	It has "file/include" source and extends tag sources in neocomplete/deoplete.

2016-08-03 10:15:28	snacks	and by "exactly" I mean "in the most confusing way possible". The second and first line seem to contradict eachother. I mean, is it saying it's a *framework*? Like, a *framework* framework, like SDL? If so, then why does the *framework* have the *application* as a requirement, instead of the other way around?

2016-08-03 15:38:14	bezhermoso	For some reason the first line in the Quickfix window is always highlighted with Search, always. Unless the cursor is there...
2016-08-03 15:38:17	bezhermoso	Is this normal?
2016-08-03 15:51:14	TommyAllenGitter	bezhermoso: yes, Search is the highlight group for the current line in qf.  i brought up using PMenuSel instead but i don't remember where that conversation left off.  i think it should only have a background highlight, and the background should always be highlighted.

2016-08-03 15:53:49	bezhermoso	Ah cool. I kinda wish it uses a different highlight group. I want my search results (/) striking (currently black text in yellow background), but wish the current line in qf to be less prominent.
2016-08-03 15:54:49	TommyAllenGitter	yeah, i don't think it was thought out.
2016-08-03 15:57:00	bezhermoso	Is this a vim thing?
2016-08-03 15:57:06	TommyAllenGitter	yeah
2016-08-03 15:57:18	bezhermoso	alright
2016-08-03 15:57:45	bezhermoso	there is no way to tell qf to use a different highlight group, huh?
2016-08-03 15:57:57	TommyAllenGitter	no, it's hard coded
2016-08-03 15:58:15	bezhermoso	ah. oh well.
2016-08-03 15:58:17	bezhermoso	Thanks!
2016-08-03 16:00:01	mhinz	I don't like that either, since I usually use a high-contrast pink for Search.
2016-08-03 16:00:34	mhinz	But adding a new group for it shouldn't be hard.

2016-08-03 16:15:14	TommyAllenGitter	actually i was looking at letting the highlight be set via `w:qf_line_highlight` that way it's completely a user preference and doesn't hurt Vim if its set.
2016-08-03 16:21:41	mhinz	When we split NonText into NonText and EndOfBuffer, we simply linked the latter to the former by default.
2016-08-03 16:24:58	TommyAllenGitter	TBH, i didn't want to figure out a new HL_FLAGS char
2016-08-03 16:25:33	mhinz	Yea, the hardest part. :-P
2016-08-03 16:26:52	TommyAllenGitter	what should it be?  `HLF_QFL` and `q`?
2016-08-03 16:30:26	mhinz	Would make sense to me, even when it's also used for location lists.
2016-08-03 16:33:16	mhinz	For comparison, the EndOfBuffer commit: https😕 /github.com/neovim/neovim/commit/4d70aae770e33c45a194634d11b9c49e866dd84b
