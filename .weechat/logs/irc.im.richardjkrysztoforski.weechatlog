2016-08-04 11:55:24	RichardJKrysztoforski	auditions are coming up again and it raised some questions about Knockout and the team

2016-08-04 11:55:49	RichardJKrysztoforski	Anne Veal and Christian sent an email yesterday to clarify
2016-08-04 11:55:52	RichardJKrysztoforski	here are the best parts of the email
2016-08-04 11:56:11	RichardJKrysztoforski	"
2016-08-04 11:56:11	RichardJKrysztoforski	 
2016-08-04 11:56:11	RichardJKrysztoforski	 Deathwish has more than exceeded this in the few short weeks you have been together.  We love your ferocious sense of camaraderie and ensemble. We love the work being done in the show.
2016-08-04 11:56:11	RichardJKrysztoforski	Knockout will stay where it is, closing out Thursday nights through at least the end of 2016. At some point in the future it may bedrock its own night. We are still open to pretty much all possibilities and want every show to thrive to it’s best ability"
2016-08-04 11:56:21	RichardJKrysztoforski	"No one on Deathwish will be removed from the team if they want to remain on it."
2016-08-04 11:56:57	RichardJKrysztoforski	the email went on to say that if we are placed on another team we will have the option of doing both if we wished
