2016-08-02 15:13:08	r0ach	finex already did this bullshit just recently pulling the plug in the middle of the halving rally
2016-08-02 15:13:32	Victorsueca	hah right, back then they said it was a database issue
2016-08-02 15:14:18	r0ach	they were probably trading on their own exchange then too and ended up on the wrong side of the trade so pulled the plug to try and crash market
2016-08-02 15:14:53	r0ach	it's WAY fishy if you actually trade BTC and watch this stuff all day and can clearly tell all these huge amounts of shorts are coming from one single guy

2016-08-02 15:15:09	Victorsueca	they definitely crashed it
2016-08-02 15:15:23	iwilcox	r0ach: If it's so clear it should be easy to provide proper proof.
